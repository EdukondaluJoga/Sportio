## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

This is a flutter project using dart as the coding langauge along with GetX Provider,
here i have provided sign up, login, dashboard, search, profile pages
and the dashboard page extends to create new sports court or create a booking request and we can scroll through bookings
IT is divided into 2 roles user and admin here the admin can have crud operation to delete or create new sports complexs

For further checkings you can run my code or go through image folders how the app is designed

Due to time constraints i cant able to hook the frontend to backend even though i have worked on backend and gone through ends to finish it but due to time constraints its unfortunate that i havent able to hook my frontend to backend
